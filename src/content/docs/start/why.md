title: Why Fels
description: What Fels is for, and where it stands today.
---

I wanted a language that stays close to the machine, like C, but is harder to get wrong and easy
to keep in your head. So Fels has a few ideas and tries to do them well:

- Memory lives in zones, and a zone is freed when its block ends.
- Errors are plain values that you check, not exceptions that fly past you.
- Code can run while the program compiles.
- One tool builds your project, runs its tests and fetches its packages.

Fels is young, and the language still changes. I write real programs in it; the biggest one is
Strata, an app for my own investments. Building it turned up a lot of bugs in the compiler, and
I fixed them along the way.

## Where it stands

- Windows x64 works from end to end.
- Linux x64 works from end to end too: the compiler runs there and builds static executables.
- There is no macOS support and no formatter yet.
- `-g` gives a program debug info: source lines, functions, parameters and locals with their
  types, in a PDB on Windows and as DWARF on Linux. On Windows it needs the import libraries of
  the Windows SDK for now.
- Programs can run without an operating system, on x86-64 and 64-bit ARM: `--target uefi` makes
  a UEFI application and `--target freestanding` an ELF for a kernel, with interrupt handlers
  as functions.
- The safety checks stay on in release builds: index bounds, null pointers, integer overflow and
  division by zero, unless you ask for `fels build --release-fast`.
- CI runs the compiler's tests on Windows and Linux on every push.

The [known issues](https://github.com/fels-lang/fels/blob/main/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) list what is
still rough, and the [changelog](https://github.com/fels-lang/fels/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) what
changed in each release.

## Tell me how it went

If you try Fels, I would love to hear about it. Open an
[issue](https://github.com/fels-lang/fels/issues) for a bug, a question or an idea. Small
programs that show a problem help the most.
